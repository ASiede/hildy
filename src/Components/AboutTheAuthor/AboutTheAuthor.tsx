            Richard Finn was born in Manhattan and is a lifelong resident of the
            area. Started in 2020 as a pandemic shutdown project, Hildyâ€™s
            Promise is his first full-length novel. A long and accomplished
            career as a sports journalist for many leading newspapers and news
            organizations, including USA Today, New York Times, Chicago Tribune
            and Associated Press, has honed a crisp and clear writing style.
            Being a fan from childhood of suspense, thriller, crime novels and
            movies has inspired this tale of greed, murder and duplicity.
